                I am a Technology Enthusiast and I am passionate about leveraging technology to produce product which improve 
                the lives of others. My passion for technology drove me to quit my job and pursue 
                my major in Computer Science from Northwestern University.
            <br/>   <br/>
            Before this, I was working with Unilever industries, which is a consumer product 
            industry dealing in both B2B and B2C arenas. I worked there for 3 years as a Software Engineer. Throughout my tenure, I was involved 
            with different teams. I have worked with operations team to design and develop solutions 
            to reduce TAT for the ongound network planners . I have worked with Business 
            teams to deliver a IOT project where we implemented a subscription model for water purifiers <br/><br/>
                I consider myself a quick learner and am always looking to learn different things and get my hands dirty.
                I have a creative and innovative mind with lots of ideas and a passion to convert 
                those ideas into scalable products that would help the society in a better way.
